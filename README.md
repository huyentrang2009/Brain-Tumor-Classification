To solve this problem, we will use two models: Vision Transformer and MobileNet V2. Vision Transformer is a model designed for image processing using the Transformer architecture, which has been successful in natural language processing problems. Meanwhile, MobileNet V2 is a model designed for fast and efficient processing of image problems.
